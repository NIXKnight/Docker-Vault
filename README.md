# **Docker Vault**

This repository is where I play with Vault (in the context of running it in Docker containers) and run through a few ideas.

If you are looking for a Kubernetes based deployment of Vault, you can look [here](https://github.com/NIXKnight/ArgoCD-Demo/tree/master/argocd/apps/vault). Though I do not consider it to be a production ready deployment.

This repo doesn't container anything that can ever be called production ready. Use this at your own risk!
